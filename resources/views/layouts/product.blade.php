                    </h2>
                    Ever done a video test before? If you have not, you will encounter it soon.
                    It is a new testing system which is rapidly growing due to its efficiency. Many companies have testified that the automated video test is cutting cost by more than a half and it is increasing transparency.  Research done on companies proved that more than 70% of companies use this system entirely and 50% use it to shortlist candidates.
                    The study adds that having videos available online, add ways for hiring and recruitment. A good example is Hiringautomated.com where a candidate being tested can complete the test at his/her own pace. Whichever time he or she will be comfortable. Pre-loaded questions are used to make both the recruiters and hiring managers a strong understanding of the process to make them carry out the test efficiently. 
                    Following is a vivid description of how the Hiringautomted.com works and what you should expect from it.

                        What is Hiringautomated.com
                    </h2>

                    It has replaced the process that initially was the recruiter calling all the candidates one by one and questioning them. Instead, the computer is prompting with a recorded video, and the recruiters shall watch the candidate's answers in their time of convenience.

                                <strong>Get the Questions: </strong>
                                A question will pop up on your screen. Hiringautomated.com has an advanced technology on this, and you will hear the panellist reading the question.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                <strong>Compose your Thoughts:  </strong>
                                You will have a set moment to gather your thoughts probably 20-30 seconds. After they are over, a countdown clock that you cannot stop will appear on the screen. When the time expires, the recording starts automatically, and here you are expected to give your feedback. If you are ready, you can skip the 30 seconds countdown and start answering immediately. 
                            </li>

                                <strong>Answer: </strong>
                                The webcam records your answer for three minutes. Just like the above process, a countdown clock will be shown. When the clock hits zero, it will automatically stop recording. If you are done answering before the time you can as well stop the recording. Remember, you can never go back once you are done with the recording. 
                                The process repeats for the remaining questions. 
                                In Hiringautomated.com we give you a simulation of how the process will be.

                    The questions asked are just the same as those asked in the traditional screening call. You should be ready for, ‘Tell me about yourself’ and ‘Walk me through your resume.’ You should also expect behavioural test questions like ‘Tell me a time when [inserts a situation].’ 
                    Questions in Hiringautiomated.com may be more targeted than the typical screening call because the panellist cannot interact with you during your answer.

                                	The first obvious need is to have a fast internet connection to allow transmission of video files via the webcam. 
                            </li>

                                	Secondly, and most importantly you need a private area free from any distractions to complete the video test uninterrupted. 
                            </li>

                                	Remember, you can spend up to 60 minutes doing a single test. You do not want a dog barking or roommate walking in on the test. Just secure the right place to avoid all interruptions.

                        Generally, the video is slightly different from the traditional screening for the following reasons. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                	<strong>Awkward: </strong> Many people take it less serious in front of a camera. 
                            </li>

                                	<strong>Unnatural: </strong> It feels strange speaking to a camera.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                	<strong>No Feedback: </strong> When you speak you expect the receiver gives you cues that he or she has understood whatever you are saying. But it is different for no cues will be given to you.

                                <strong>Personal presentation: </strong> Being in front of a camera interacts you more with the panellist than the verbal calls.

                                <strong>Fewer people in between: </strong> Some companies are forced to hire recruiters to do them the shortlisting process. In Hiringautomated.com the company needs few panellists to carry out the recruitment. 
                            </li>

                                <strong>Flexible: </strong> You need not coordinate schedules with the panellists or sneak from your work to answer calls. You work at your convenient time.
